                    <p><a name="info"></a>A warm welcome and a cosy bedroom await you at our B&#x26;B which is perfectly located in the charming rural village of Mezzano, mid-way along the scenic Primiero valley with its backdrop of the majestic Dolomite range &#x2013; Pale di San Martino (UNESCO World Heritage Site). It is set in a peaceful sunny position just above the old village, it has a lovely garden and an idyllic terrace which commands spectacular views of the surrounding mountains.</p> 
<p>Though our home is a recently built eco-home, it is built in the local Alpine style but also has a slight Englishness. It is only 4 mins walk down to the centre of Mezzano (part of the association &#x201C;Borghi piu&#x2019; Belli d&#x2019;Italia&#x201D;), and an ideal place to base yourself to explore the magnificent mountains and maybe some of the historic cities of the northern Italian plains.</p>

<h2>Neighbourhood overview</h2>
<p>Mezzano offers an excellent range of services and a rich program of events in the summer season. If you happen to rise early, wander down through the narrow streets of the old centre, you will maybe see a local strolling back from matins or carefully tending their weed-less kitchen gardens which are nestled between stone-built houses. The village boast a unique collection of outdoor installations created by Italian artists that artistically mirror the local tradition of neat wood stacking in innovative and attractive ways. The village has a bank, post-office, newsagent, tourist office in season, bars that also offer snacks, 2 supermarkets, chemists, restaurant, hairdresser.</p>
<p>In the area; take one of the 5 scenic routes to the lively town of Fiera with its many tourist shops, restaurants and bars. The shortest route on foot is 35 mins (3KM), or 6 mins by car. In summer busses stop just near by the house, otherwise main stop is in the village centre (4 mins). The special summer service runs from mid-June to September, it offers a good service that can take you up to fantastic spots to start your mountain walks (winter season ski-bus service to San Martino). Yes, walking is a must here, you will find yourself in unspoilt and scenically breath-taking places. Visit the Paneveggio Nature Park with its fragrant pine forests, valleys of Canali, Vaneggio, Vanoi, walk in the ski/mountaineering resort of San Martino di Castrozza, take a cable car there to get up to those most intensely beautiful panoramic points with incredible views of other Dolomite ranges, the Rolle Pass – these are amongst just some of the many possibilities in the area.</p>
<p>Back down on the plains there are the towns of Feltre (33km with nearest train station), Trento (90km), Treviso (90 km) Padua (115km) and Venice (130km), an adventure to visit with public transport, but possible in a day!</p>
<p>And let us not forget our local art here, as apart from the wood stacks there is the more traditional Parish church above Fiera that hosts a rare 15th century depiction of the “Hortus Conclusus”  a mural of the Virgin Mary and a unicorn, another interesting 13th century frieze is in the church of San Vittore perched above Tonadico, it depicts the life of Christ but also has images of chain mail clad soldiers marching off to the crusades. There are also the 4 Nature Park visitor centres, local artefact museum Fiera, WWI museum Vanoi.</p>
